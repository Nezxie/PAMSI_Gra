# PAMSI_Gra
This is a project done to get through a course asociated with AI during my studies.
It's not very good but i was just learning how to code then.

In this console app you play tic-tac-toe on a 4x4 board vs AI. You declare where you want to put your symbol by specifying x and y as shown on the start screen. Then AI places its symbol. 

i don't remember if there is a message if you win or lose, probably yes.

It's a really old project, and i will make it private once i have more projects in my github, cause i know it's not really worth showing anyone.

If you want to know more about my AI algoritm you should just check out my code, cause i don't really remember and now I don't feel like reading it - maybe i will someday, then i will write here smth about it. I remember it used alpha to calculate sth and was really basic.

Sorry for this, I didn't really pay attention to github few years ago.
